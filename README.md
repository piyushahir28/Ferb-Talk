<h1 align="center">Ferb - Latin</h1>

Ferb-Latin is a translation app to convert English to Ferb Latin, created using a [funtranslations.com](https://funtranslations.com/ferb-latin) API. During their routine summer fun, the two brothers Phineas and Ferb(in a Dinsney series) create their own language, Ferb Latin.
